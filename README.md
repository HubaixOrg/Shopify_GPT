# Hube_Realtime_GPTxShopify-chatbot
# Description:
This project aims to integrate Google's PaLM (Pathways Language Model) with Shopify's API to create a sophisticated Language Model (LLM) capable of providing real-time product information. The system is designed to understand and respond to user queries about product details, prices, and availability, directly interacting with a Shopify store's database.

# Key Features
# Real-Time Data Retrieval: 
Fetches current product details, prices, and stock availability from Shopify.
# Natural Language Processing: 
Utilizes Google PaLM for understanding and processing user queries.
# User-Friendly Interaction: 
Offers an intuitive way for users to inquire about products using natural language.
# API Integration: 
Seamlessly integrates with Shopify API to access and retrieve product information.
# Error Handling:
Gracefully manages unclear queries, product unavailability, or API downtime, providing user-friendly feedback.
# Technology Stack
Google PaLM: For processing and interpreting natural language queries.
Shopify API: To access real-time data about products, prices, and availability.
Python: Primary programming language used for developing the integration and handling backend operations.
# How It Works
Query Interpretation: The system uses Google's PaLM to interpret user queries about products.
Shopify API Interaction: Based on the interpreted query, the system interacts with Shopify's API to fetch relevant product information.
Response Generation: The system formats the retrieved data into a concise, understandable response and communicates it back to the user.
Continuous Learning: The system constantly improves its query understanding and response accuracy based on user interactions.
